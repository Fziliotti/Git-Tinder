## Git Tinder - in development

I had created this project to test some features present in PWA's implementations using the recent frameworks/libs like React (create-react-app), Svelte (using Sapper), and more.

This backend/frontend project was inspired by Tindev project developed in the Omnistack 2019

You have to install on your computer:
- Node Js
- npm
  
Then, go to the folder and install the dependencies:
`npm install`

To run this backend server in the port 3000:
`npm run serve`

To run the front-end project developed with:
`npm run front-react`

Some things you go see is:
- The API was developed using express (framework nodeJS)
- Some features of the Ecmascript6+ specifications
- CSS3 (some items like grid, flexbox and navbar decoration =))

Towards the restful api concept:
 - [ ] HATEOAS
 - [ ] Uses stateless interactions
 - [ ] Communicates over HTTP 
 - [ ] Uses standard HTTP status codes
 - [ ] Manipulates resources
